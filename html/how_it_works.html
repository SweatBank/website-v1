            Wondered what the "bank" in SweatBank is all about? <br/> <br/>
            When you record a goal, you’ll deposit $ with us that you get back if you achieve your goal. <br/> <br/>
            Deposits are $5/week, so longer timeframes have higher incentives. <br/> <br/>
            If you don’t achieve your goal, you’ll get paid back based on the amount of progress that you made. For example: <br/> <br/>
            You can currently do <span class = "accent"> 20 push-ups</span>, and your goal is to do <span class = "accent"> 40 push-ups</span>. <br/>
            You set your timeframe to <span class = "accent"> two weeks</span>, and deposit <span class = "accent">$10</span>. <br/>
            By the end of two weeks, you are able to do <span class = "accent"> 30 push-ups</span>. <br/> <br/>
            You get <span class = "accent"> $5</span> back! (because you made it half way to your goal).

        </span>

            You didn't think we were just going to keep your money, did you?! <br/> <br/>
            Well... we are :D but only a fraction. <br/> <br/>
            If you don't achieve your goal, <span class = "accent">80%</span> of the money that you leave with us will be given to the charity of your choice, and the other <span class = "accent"> 20% </span> will be used to support our team.

            Sure you'll feel good about yourself when your money gets sent to Toys for Tots, but we think you'll feel better when you commit to a goal and make it happen. <br/> <br/>
            (you might just feel so good that you go ahead and donate the money anyway) <br/> <br/>
            The purpose of the SweatBank platform is to help users develop the habit of stating and achieving goals of any magnitude. <br/><br/>
